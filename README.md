# AI Workflow Cursor Plugin

Build and publish the `psters-ai-workflow` Cursor Marketplace plugin from this repository.

Included plugin:

- **psters-ai-workflow**: daily AI development workflow (rules, skills, agents, and commands)

## Getting started

[Use this template](https://github.com/cursor/plugin-template/generate) to create a new repository, then customize:

1. `.cursor-plugin/marketplace.json`: set marketplace `name`, `owner`, and `metadata`.
2. `plugins/psters-ai-workflow/.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`: set `name` (lowercase kebab-case), `displayName`, `author`, `description`, `keywords`, `license`, and `version`.
3. Replace placeholder rules, skills, agents, commands, hooks, scripts, and logos.

To add more plugins, see `docs/add-a-plugin.md`.

## Single plugin vs multi-plugin

This repository is currently configured as a **single maintained plugin** inside `plugins/`.

If you later decide to move to true single-plugin root mode, move plugin contents to the repository root, keep one `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`, and remove `.cursor-plugin/marketplace.json`.

## Submission checklist

- Each plugin has a valid `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`.
- Plugin names are unique, lowercase, and kebab-case.
- `.cursor-plugin/marketplace.json` entries map to real plugin folders.
- All frontmatter metadata is present in rule, skill, agent, and command files.
- Logos are committed and referenced with relative paths.
- `node scripts/validate-template.mjs` passes.
- Repository link is ready for submission to the Cursor team (Slack or `kniparko@anysphere.com`).
